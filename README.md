# Medium Posts Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the collection of my Medium blog posts. Each post is saved in markdown format, allowing for easy reading, version control, and the ability to freely share the content. Please respect the intellectual property rights attached to these writings.

## Structure

The `posts` directory contains subdirectories for each topic I write about, such as `data_science` or `machine_learning`. Inside each of these directories are individual markdown files for each post.

## How to Use

To read a post, simply navigate to the relevant directory and open the markdown (.md) file. Markdown files can be viewed directly on GitHub, or can be viewed in a markdown viewer for better formatting.

You can also clone the repository to your local machine for offline reading. Use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hugosouto/medium_posts.git
```
